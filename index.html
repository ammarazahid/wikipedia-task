                <strong>Irritator</strong> is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a
                    href="spinosaurid theropod dinosaur">spinosaurid theropod dinosaur</a> that lived in what is now <a
                    href="Brazil">Brazil</a> during the <a href="Albian stage">Albian stage</a> of the <a
                    href="Early Cretaceous Period">Early Cretaceous Period</a>, about 110 million years ago. It is known
                from a nearly complete <a href="skull">skull</a> found in the <a href="Romualdo Formation">Romualdo
                    Formation</a> of the <a href="Araripe Basin. Fossil dealers">Araripe Basin. Fossil dealers</a> had
                acquired this skull and illegally sold it to the <a
                    href="State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart.">State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart.</a> In
                <a href="1996">1996</a>, the specimen became the <a href="holotype">holotype</a> of the <a
                    href="type species">type species</a> <em><strong>Irritator challengeri</strong></em>. The genus name
                comes from the
                word "irritation", reflecting the feelings of <a href="paleontologists">paleontologists</a> who found
                the skull had been heavily damaged and altered by the collectors. The <a href="species">species</a> name
                is an homage to the fictional character <a href="Professor Challenger">Professor Challenger</a> from <a
                    href="Arthur Conan Doyle's">Arthur Conan Doyle's</a> novels.

                Many paleontologists regard <em><strong>Angaturama limai</strong></em>—known from a snout tip that was
                described later in
                1996—as a potential <a href="junior synonym">junior synonym</a> of Irritator. Both animals hail from the
                same <a href="stratigraphic units">stratigraphic units</a> of the Araripe Basin. It was also previously
                proposed that Irritator and Angaturama's skull parts belonged to the same specimen. Although this has
                been cast into doubt, more overlapping fossil material is needed to confirm whether they are the same
                animal or not. Other spinosaurid skeletal material, some of which could belong to Irritator or
                Angaturama, was retrieved from the Romualdo Formation, allowing for a replica skeleton to be made and
                mounted for display at the <a href="National Museum of Rio de Janeiro">National Museum of Rio de
                    Janeiro</a> in 2009.

                Estimated at between 6 and 8 meters (20 and 26 ft) in length, Irritator weighed around 1 tonne (1.1
                short tons), making it one of the smallest spinosaurids known. Its long, shallow and slender snout was
                lined with straight and unserrated conical teeth. Lengthwise atop the head ran a thin <a
                    href="sagittal crest">sagittal crest</a>, to which powerful neck muscles were likely anchored. The
                nostrils were positioned far back from the tip of the snout, and a rigid <a
                    href="secondary palate">secondary palate</a> on the roof of the mouth would have strengthened the
                jaw when feeding. Belonging to a subadult, Irritator challengeri's holotype remains the most completely
                preserved spinosaurid skull yet found. The Angaturama snout tip expanded to the sides in a <a
                    href="rosette">rosette</a>-like shape, bearing long teeth and an unusually tall crest. One possible
                skeleton indicates it, like other spinosaurids, had enlarged first-finger claws and a <a
                    href="sail">sail</a> running down its back.

                Irritator had been mistaken initially for a <a href="pterosaur">pterosaur</a>, and later a <a
                    href="maniraptoran">maniraptoran</a> dinosaur. In 1996, the animal was identified as a spinosaurid
                theropod. The <a href="holotype">holotype</a> skull was thoroughly prepared before being redescribed in
                2002, confirming this classification. Both Irritator and Angaturama belong to the <a
                    href="Spinosaurinae subfamily">Spinosaurinae subfamily</a>. A <a href="generalist diet">generalist
                    diet</a>—like that of today's <a href="crocodilians">crocodilians</a>—has been suggested; Irritator
                might have preyed mainly on fish and any other small prey animals it could catch. Fossil evidence is
                known of an individual that ate a pterosaur, either from hunting or scavenging it. Irritator may have
                had <a href="semiaquatic">semiaquatic</a> habits, and inhabited the tropical environment of a coastal <a
                    href="lagoon">lagoon</a> surrounded by dry regions. It coexisted with other carnivorous theropods as
                well as turtles, <a href="crocodyliforms">crocodyliforms</a>, and a large number of pterosaur and fish
                species.</p>
